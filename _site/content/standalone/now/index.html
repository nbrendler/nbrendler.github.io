<h1>What I'm doing now</h1>
<p>At a high-level I'm working on sprucing up my online presence and portfolio. I'm
looking for some remote work I can do from Taiwan, preferably in JS/React,
contract or otherwise. Hit me up!</p>
<h4>Coding</h4>
<p>I am working to finish up <code>keybase-chat-tui</code>, a rust terminal UI that I started
a few months ago that didn't quite make it over the finish line. I was inspired
to come back to it after seeing a couple of nice projects like <code>cordless</code>
(Discord client) and <code>spotify-tui</code>.</p>
