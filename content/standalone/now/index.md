# What I'm doing now

At a high-level I'm working on sprucing up my online presence and portfolio. I'm
looking for some remote work I can do from Taiwan, preferably in JS/React,
contract or otherwise. Hit me up!

#### Coding

I am working to finish up `keybase-chat-tui`, a rust terminal UI that I started
a few months ago that didn't quite make it over the finish line. I was inspired
to come back to it after seeing a couple of nice projects like `cordless`
(Discord client) and `spotify-tui`.
